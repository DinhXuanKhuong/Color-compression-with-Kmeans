# Color-compression-with-Kmeans

## Introduction
### About the project
- Nowadays, with the rapid development of technology and digital content, images have become more detailed and complex. As a result, storage and bandwidth requirements are becoming increasingly demanding. One of the key techniques to address this challenge is image compression, which reduces the amount of data required to represent an image without significantly compromising its visual quality.
- In this project, I explore an effective and widely used clustering algorithm in machine learning, the K-means algorithm, to perform image compression by reducing the number of unique colors in an image. The project applies K-means clustering with different values of K (specifically K = 3, 5, 7, and more) to compress the image and analyze the trade-off between compression ratio and visual fidelity
### Input and output
- **Input**: An RGB image (in common formats such as PNG or JPEG). Each pixel in the image is represented by a 3-dimensional vector corresponding to the Red, Green, and Blue color intensities.
- **Ouput**: A compressed version of the original image where the number of unique colors is reduced to exactly K. The compressed image maintains the general appearance of the original image but with fewer colors, which results in lower storage requirements.
### Primary goals
- To apply the K-means clustering algorithm to compress images.
- To observe the impact of different values of K on the visual quality and compression ratio of the image.
- To understand the trade-off between image quality and compression efficiency.
- To visualize and compare the results of different K values.
- To gain practical experience with machine learning algorithm â€“ k-means.
